Practical cases:

### - [Biomakers:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/biomakers.R)
Do patients that express one or more of these biomarkers have better, or worse, outcomes that those that do not express these biomarkers?

### - [Forecasting credit default probability:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/CreditDefaultLogit.R)
On this study, we sought to explore some way to forecast the chance that a specific customer, who want to apply for a specific bank product, will default on his/her payments. That said, trying to estimate the probability of default. Give some application to estimate the credit-worthiness of a customer.

### - [Financial Data:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/Finance_study_script.R)
We analyse three major stocks indices, Dow Jones, DAX and Nikkei in relation to the exchange rate between US Dolar, Euro and Yen.
Research Questions: 
				how large was the impact of the recent financial crisis on the stock markets?;
				how correlated is the development between the stock market?;
				what is the relationship between stock market returns and exchange rates?.

### - [Robust Statistics:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/RobustStatistics.R)
A practical case to explore issues around the topics of regression assumption, non parametric tests, and bootstrap analyses.

### - [New Statistics:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/NewStatistics.R)
A use-case that show issues surrounding power analysis, confiance intervals and bayesian statistics.

### - [Machine Learning:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/MLfitting.R)
A set of practical examples that dive into the ML tasks and implementation like [feature extraction](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/MLfeatures.R), [modeling](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/MLmodel.R) and [fitting](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/MLfitting.R) models, [optimization](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/Optimization.R) and [prediction](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/Prediction.R).

### - [Analyzing Sales data:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/Salecase.R)

In this case study we perform data wrangling and merge the two datasets merged in one. It also goes beyond and addresses research questions such as: <br>
- how large the fluctuation of sales were per store.<br>
- whether sales number go up or down in holidays.<br>
- how well we can predict sales numbers from other variables, time series analysis predict future turnovers.<br>
Because there are many timepoints per store, we aggregate the values to interpret p-values using mixed effect models.<br>

### - [Time Series Analysis:](https://github.com/carlosug/ranalytics/blob/master/src/timeseries.R)
Quarterly beer sales data have been deeply explored. It uses Holt-Winters seasonal method to capture seasonality and predict for next two years. Also uses ARIMA model to predict next 2 years.
